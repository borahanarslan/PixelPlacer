Asp.net MVC Video Creator and player
This app Allows a User to upload videos and saves to SQL server Database
The user can then modify the video using chroma keying effects for green screen.
The application features drag and drop so a user can add multiple green screen videos as overlays to a background video.
The application also permits resizing that maintains aspect ratio for the videos.
A user can play back their newly created video and as a fun extra feature can play in an interactive mode
In the Interactive mode, multiple event listeners have been utilized so a user can mouseover or click to play each video separately.

Tooling and details to recreate coming soon !!!!!
